# jsonObj-to-pythonObj


## Estimated time

30-45 minutes

## Level of difficulty

Medium

## Objectives

Learn how to:

1. Use the json module and its basic facilities;
2. Encode and decode JSON strings from/to Python objects.


Your task is to write a code which has exactly the same conversation with the user and:

1. Defines a class named Vehicle, whose objects can carry the vehicle data shown above (the structure of the class should be deducted from the above dialog â€” call it "reverse engineering" if you want)
2. Defines a class/function able to encode the Vehicle object into an equivalent JSON string;
3. Defines a class/function able to decode the JSON string into the newly created Vehicle object.

Of course, some basic data validity checks should be done, too. We're sure you're careful enough to protect your code from reckless users.

The program should look like the following:
